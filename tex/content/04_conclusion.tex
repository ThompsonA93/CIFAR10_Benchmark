\chapter{Conclusion}
The evluation of neural networks, their structure and their variables, made it evident that searching for optimal models is a suboptimal approach to generate valuable data.
For less vital purposes, it is better to create a neural network model specifically suited for the available data and then let it evaluate results, even if that will be less efficient than different models computed by various configurations and setups. 
Not only does it save a lot of resources but there is no real certainty that a better neural network model will be produced.
