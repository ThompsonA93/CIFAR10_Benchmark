\chapter{Methods and Resources}
The datasets are downloaded from a remote destination using the \href{https://keras.io/api/datasets/cifar10/}{keras.datasets} package.
Besides additional utility libraries, such as \href{https://matplotlib.org/}{matplotlib} and \href{https://seaborn.pydata.org/}{seaborn} for displaying graphics, the \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/}{Tensorflow} library supplies the necessary algorithms for creating and executing neural network computations and hyperparameter evaluation.

After downloading the CIFAR-10 dataset it is necessary to perform some data transmutations.
The data values are normalized from the value range of (0..255) to (0..1) by simple division. Then training and test labels are categorized from a class vector of integers to a binary class matrix. Lastly, the amount of the data is reduced to decrease the time necessary to run analytics.
Afterward, the computation commences.
