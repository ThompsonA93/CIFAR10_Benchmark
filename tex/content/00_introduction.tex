\chapter{Introduction}
This report discusses neural network experimentation on the \href{https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html}{CIFAR-10 dataset}.
The implementation is handled in the programming language \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python}, using the libraries \href{https://keras.io/}{Keras} and \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/}{SKLearn}.
The goal is to analyse various models and identify the impact of different parametrization of the underlying algorithms.
