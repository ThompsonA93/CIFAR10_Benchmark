\chapter{Introduction}
This report discusses neural network experimentation on the \href{https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html}{CIFAR-10 dataset}.
The implementation is written in the programming language \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python}, using the libraries \href{https://keras.io/}{Keras} and \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/}{SKLearn}.
The results by SKLearn are omitted within the report due to length limits but are still at the viewers disposal within the log files.
The goal is to analyse various models and identify the impact of different parametrization of the underlying algorithms.
